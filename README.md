# DENTAL BACK END

> ### `Code structure`

### 1. Back End

The main code will be inside `./back/index.ts`.
Added to that there is also 2 main folders, which are `models` and `resolvers`.

Inside `models` you can find all schemas, for example: `group.ts, user.ts etc...`

Same as that `mutations, typedefs, queries` will include all the mutations, typeDefs and queries.
